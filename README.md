# Escape From The Bottle

I used LD38 as an opportunity to develop my very first game. It was fun and I was able to learn alot.

Your character was put into a small bottle world. Find items to remove obstacles and help him to escape.

The game was developed with the Godot Engine. I never used this engine before LD38. I have to say, it works out better than expected. Sounds was made with [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html).
