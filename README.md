# Escape From The Bottle

Escape From The Bottle is my very first video game. Your character was put into a small bottle world. Find items, remove obstacles and help him to escape.

The game was developed during the Ludum Dare 38 Game Jam in 48 hours with the topic "A Small World" in mind. Godot was used as engine.
